The skin is skinning this morning. I feel like every month I've been in a different country. Right now we're headed to Tokyo, which is one of my favorites, obviously. I'm actually meeting one of my best friends, Tiff, in Japan, who were just in Bali last month with Sony. I'm in Malay too. Thank you! I just found out that Tiff and I are flying to different areas of Japan since the beginning of the world. It's got a pleasure, sure video. I don't even know what this happened, but I haven't had anything different for it. My checker texted me as a fever, so she sent me a list of the names. But I just heard it's a myth that she went to was two. I thought only one transfer came in. So hopefully that was fine. I also landed a little bit earlier than her, so I involved to go to my lineage. Wow, I'm not going to Japan in the fall since post-COVID. There are a lot of people. Immigration took at least an hour to go through, and I feel like it was pretty speedy. Make sure you do your Japan arrival bar if you are cutting here. This is how down we love Komi-Thom. Make sure you always stand on the right side or the left side, depending on which border Japan you're in. Especially during a rush hour, people will pass through the other side, so really make sure you stick to one side. I thought I would show you guys if you ever want to shot like that. Actually, I ate double-sided, off the body. Stick to both sides, stick to your phone on one side, and then the wall for the other. Alright, we finally made it to the hotel. The tip is about an hour and a half away. Let me give you guys a little hotel tour to start. The bathroom is actually probably the most exciting part, so I will show you that first. Look how big this bathroom is. If you have ever been to Japan, you know that this is like a condo. A massive, massive bathroom. This hotel is called the Shinagawa Prince Hotel. I believe it's a three-star hotel. Over here, this way, we have two beds. And again, if you've ever been to Japan, you know that the beds not touching each other is actually a huge flex. I know the room looks very small by American standards, but honestly, this is pretty dang good. Then over here, there is a little makeup, vanity situation, table, and an extra chair. My only complaint is that it doesn't have AC controls that are super potent. The only thing it has is this very archaic looking dial, which I turned down, but it still feels really hot, because it's 90 degrees out. This little bitch, a bunch of lights, the wrong ass place. Why it looks so cute? This is so funny, because when I was at TIPS wedding, I lost the lov-ed iPhone charger, it's actually Kevin's that I stole. I used to hate it because it's so ugly. It has these yellow cords that are on it. It's very ugly. It shows up in Japan, and I'm like, oh my god. Did you buy the same one? I was like, no, literally Matt gave it to me to use on this trip. Oh my god, this is just so dumb, because I literally already ordered another one. But here's the thing. Okay, so Kevin bought this one, right? So I ordered the new one, the new one doesn't have yellow cords, because it looks so ugly. I ordered the old black one. I don't have to see this. Yeah, it's really ugly. No, it's so heavy. I was like, no, I don't think I actually want to bring this except for Kinevin. It's weird and useful. You're gonna miss one. I already tried my phone on. It is very nice, and that's a stir. But it's also actually known as yours. Yeah, we charge our stuff and yeah. Probably on this. So, good morning guys, this is our first cold day in Tokyo. We're currently headed to the Green Line. Our first stop for this morning is the Creep House, the Tokyo Green Pulse, which I have never actually been to. So we're doing something new for both of us. Also, making it the best Japanese tour guide, just telling me a little tips and tricks next time up here. I'm like, oh, good to know. I tell them I've never come here without you again. And then after that, we're going to the cat temple. So a coldokujikambo, which has all the little cat stuff. Hence why the bits, we've got white and red going on to hopefully match with the cats. And let's go. Okay, they have a new feature for the Sweetgoord where essentially you don't have to do anything. You just leave your phone and it'll tap your Sweetgoord open it. Platform 3. So when you are opening on Google Maps, it tells you exactly which platform to go to. When the next trains are and then which leak of the train to be on. We're seeing there's some other humans who are here, which is promising. They're not bad. We are currently here at the Khrampop Shop. It's not open quite yet, so we're waiting in line. Look how cute they are. Are you kidding me? Look how cute these are because they're original cranes and then we have chocolate as well. Strawberry cranes. This is the most exciting. They are off to the cat temple. They're so exciting. I just can't. I just want to vlog for you guys. But I also want to be able to look back on these memories. It's our first trip where it's not what the brand is just us do. It's us making every trip sound like a horse trip. Like putting some sort of cap. The only one at first time. I'm wearing a trip. Yeah, first time since you became a white. The first time I have a kid trip. First time after first baby, first time out of her second baby. I've just got this sparkling apple cider. And my Japanese may have recommended it saying it's very delicious. It really is so delicious. You guys know I don't ever drink anything that's not water, but this. Which I believe I'm having. Okay, that's the difference between Tiffany and Tiffany. If I try something and it tastes horrible, I'll never eat it again. Tiffany's like, okay, so next morning, what did I try it again? You see if I like it. Let me give it a few things to Tries, of course. No, no. You give them like three. Three. Sometimes. One time I told Tiffany I was like, oh my god, this thing is so nasty. You shouldn't eat it. And she was like, can I try it? This is the much of that. And I was like, no, it literally tastes so bad. I'm telling you to warn you. And she was like, no, I want to try it. Flareus. Like. Flareus. I can't lose that. I don't go. You take it off. You have a little bit of stuff. You like this? You know, this one is for baby, actually. It doesn't look like this. It's for baby. It's very thick. So you, this one is pretty, actually, really good. Very thick. Never before I thought you'd have a stall on the floor. We are currently in line with our new building. It's just going to be the best thing, just liking it. That's the best thing ever. My expectations are like here. I know, so if it trumps that, then you're going to look at it. Oh, this one is here because that's how high the camera goes. But it's really here. It's up there. It's a fire. Fire. Fire. I'm so happy eating good food. I actually like looking at that and I'm upset if I'm eating fast food. You two are going to be like, why am I wasting my time? Why am I wasting my count? Yeah, also because of the things going on. I'm far so good at eating. Did we just, are we the last of the 50? I have two cutlets here, and two plus one. But we're actually splitting them. We're going to do 1.5 each. It's more economical to order at this way. Oh my god. I don't think I'm going to have to eat it. I think we should run out of one hour. Is it good? It's good. No. What is so rare? I tripped on for luggage about 20 minutes ago and she said I gave her the dick. I don't want you to give Kevin the egg because it's so big. Good morning. We're headed to the bulk we are in Asakusa for insulogy, which has never been to yet. So we said it for food. This is probably one of my favorite things to do about. We're like about to recommend on a Tokyo Itinerary. This is probably one or two. Or you definitely have to say it. This is the entryway gate. She is. My favorite part of all is that you can walk down and there's a bunch of food and lots of different things you can try. I have never seen Mickey. It's so happy to see a snack. Literally my entire life. My favorite. This is my favorite snack ever. It's from the one of the most people. I don't normally eat it with a sauce packet, but if you like to speed your things, I would recommend. This is the most fun snack ever. I have never tried it. I will not hurt you. It's so exciting for this. Maybe I can. I will try it. It's so exciting for this. Maybe I can. I will try it. I will try it. It's so exciting for this. Maybe I can. I will try it. Apparently on the gym. We're done. This is tips number one. We desire the over the gym we have to get. We have only 5 pm. We have actually just passed by. We have only 3 people. This is the time to go. It's casual. It's so... It's so sugar-none. It's coming out to play. It's like a... Different lights light up. And then you'll know which seats are open. But it's very interesting in America. It's all individual stalls. Up right when you get here, everybody gets their own little individual stalls. Then you have a pen and paper. And then you're just so full. The ones that you like. I think I'm gonna go medium here as well. Hi, it's me, Aishimatsu. This is great for entrepreneurs because it's all just DIY. I don't have to talk to anyone which is really amazing. They have little packers on the side here. And this is what you use to communicate what you need. If you're eating with a friend, you can actually remove the divider in the middle. I'm looking pretty dang good. Tina is cute. I'm gonna put my egg in my ramen to get heated a little bit. So that's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna cook up the... The best thing I've ever had. Actually, I don't have that many things to eat. We haven't had it for an entire day. We're getting dessert. We're super full, but we're in Mario and Gray, which is my absolute favorite. Although I will say there is definitely a lot of hair. That's gonna be great for yourself. So delicious. We're gonna do something. Hello! Hello! It is a last-day in Japan. To please first thing tomorrow morning at 9am, I leave you at 4pm. That's really exciting because we are eating from Parts Bay through. Today, we're actually gonna be focusing on making a food video, which, lucky for me, means I did to eat a lot of food. This is our last topic Kyoto. It is actually a place called the Kiwi Kustokomi, which is one of my favorite places to eat ever. It's a Japanese hamburger, which if you've never had before, you can just be a different from an American hamburger. And you can get localities, which means that you can get a second and a third meat. So you can get up to three, they start you with one. Last time I did the number of having two, and then I think I gave my third one to Gavin. We just encountered the biggest tourists of all time. She was like, this is the 21st century, helping you not reservation. She's like, I'm a tourist. I don't even know if you've come here at 8am. So there I have the first plane. That's a good trip. I think I've spent eight nights with my friend from Tokyo and many other shots. Some friends go to a hotel, the hotel is good for the pack of food portion. We also went back to Tokyo and watched the other entrance exams. We were pretty close to working out before we got to Tokyo. We were thinking that if we could go there, we would need people to meditate on it, or find footage. I guess you're able to delight in yourself seulfinding other things. You guys are so sweet, yes. No, right. But you're like, oh, I'm not gonna get just mine. It's 50 dollars, it's like, go get it. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Welcome to our Osaka Pekasping. Welcome to our Osaka Hotel. There's two beds. They actually set up three by accident. And it's really good. The location's very good. I'll show you our little view from outside our window. We did get my favorite cheesecake all the time. This is the Uddo cheesecake. It's very, very, very, very jiggly. Oh my god, it's a Halloween version. They have a Halloween stamp. I didn't even realize it. She's going to try it for the first time. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to devour this. See what? Whoa. Not the huge piece. I'm sorry. Cheers. Cheers, like I said. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ It's really simple. It'll go out of your mouth. I'm going to call that cheesecake. There's what you remember. You had too many reasons. Get Justice cheesecake without the thing. Muscat tart. Muscat tart. Dude. Oh my god. I don't even know where to start. This wasn't even a good piece. Where's the party? Yeah, where's this bit? She lost it. It's skimping out on the part that we're most excited about. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. I prefer this strawberry. Yeah. Gently a little souffle. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ It's been... It is gone. I'm not putting it out. Me too. Tiff is going to try Japanese milk. Japanese milk for the first time. There you go. Japanese milk. Japanese milk. Japanese milk. I'm just saying Japanese milk. Japanese milk. Yeah. Japanese milk. You try it first. Make sure it's a good one. Like... What? Huh. I've never seen you. Anyone so happy to drink. Like milk. While it's sweet. It's my turn. So... Tiff took my charger from the wedding. I already know this information. But did you buy the same one? I was like, no, literally Matt gave it to me. And to use on this trip. And I was like, do you want to take it with you to be a mom? Because... How are you going to... I guess I'm you for three hours. Yeah, exactly. And she's like, no. Unless you wanted it to me too. You're supposed to say Mickey, this is the best charger ever. And I regret calling it ugly. And Matt, it is ugly and bad. It is ugly and bad. You can't judge it by its outside. Yeah. Okay. It has USB-C and... Like A. So you can help yourself and help others. The only thing it's missing is a little like wrist slit. So then you can like hold your phone. And it at the same time. $100 business idea. Are you going to take it with you or what? Do you want me to take it? Only if you apologize for saying to them that I'll give it back to you. That's too much of a fancy mirror pack. Who wants to watch it? All right. It is very nice. Into the desk. And Mickey. Mickey. Really? Yeah, it's really? Yes. Fine. You can take her. Okay, thank you. Hello. I'll write it down. Good. Tiff doesn't want to take a picture of the granite. I know. And I'm telling her it's very famous. Like she'll regret it if she doesn't take a picture. So now she's taking a picture. You're right. No. Not that. That's the wrong thing. No. It's gone by. You got to look what you're doing. I meant that one. How能生 Quez bru! I was on the other side of it, how much?! For one man, we'reoughing. Oh! How are we going to do that? We're inside it's little pool. Oh, that's good. Ooh. It's really good. If we were friends while I was in nursing school, and I needed to act on you to do like an IV insertion. Absolutely not. You wouldn't be my friend anymore. It's not her you can't be my friend anymore. Okay so if I was practicing microblading and I wanted to be a cosmologist, would you let me and my provider eye brow? Yes I would. I would 100% live out with blushing. Yes. What about boat talks? My only ask is that filler. Sure. I don't care my only ask because that is like sanitary. I don't care if I'm bossy for a while. Let's find microblading. Get a tattoo removal. You have to try it on somebody like better me than someone good friend. That's a good one. I'm not going to let you practice your IV insertion on me. It's not even a big deal. That's so scary. I hate needles already. You don't care about me. You don't care about me if you want it in here. No no. That means you don't care about me if you knew I hated needles. You're like can I practice like sticking this needle in your mouth? No one else wants me to do it. And I can't graduate. I'm not doing it. Fine. But then I get to do something in return. Well what do you want in return? I don't know yet. One, two, three. Do you want to say hello to the vlog? Look how I'm feeling. Hi. Hi. Hi. That is good. Big fan. Hmm. I hate like something you would like. Hmm. I don't like it. Are you serious? I'm so scared. You go first. Okay. The one thing I always forget how to say in Japanese. Is it good to be honest? I think my first, bad and first purchase, we are at $17. It's hurt enabling everything but I'm getting these really cute sambas that come in a beige that has a little bit of a pink tint. It's basically the same price but tax rate. I don't know why I take that. I keep saying it's so much cheaper because it's not on it. But, but but but. They're not in stock. You are. Thank you for looking more. So I feel better about that. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Have a good night. Have a good night. I paid $100 for the shoes. Refused to pay the $22 yen for the bag. Yeah. We're going to get a nice snack. No. Cute.
